Reviewer 1 comment on paper:
The proposed solution presented in the paper is Ok, however the presentation of the algorithm is poor. I believe that at least some details should be given in the paper in the form of flowchart (or other appropriate diagram). Form the current version of the paper, implementation of the summation process is not clear enough. In the “Measurements” part of the paper, I think that the sentence “Large number is 1.0 and small number is 2^24epsilon” is not correct (it can be concluded that small number is 1?). Similarly, the sentence “One large number 1.0 is summed with small numbers 2^24epsilon and tiny numbers 2^26epsilon^2” is probably not correct.
