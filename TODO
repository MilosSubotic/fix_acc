- Move C++ to separate folder.

- Testing:
	- Could DeJaGNU help
	- Use MPFR for reference
	- Make something for easy testing
	- Code coverage

- Optimizations:
	- Array of inline function as lookup table
		- After all 5 way lookup table indexing and function call 
			is a unpredictable (for speculation in CPU) and slow as 
			mul-add-jmp, it's even better because it don't need padding,
			and it's still question could I enforce equal distance between 
			jump addresses in inline assembler.
	- Measure perfomance and optimize:
		- OProfile
